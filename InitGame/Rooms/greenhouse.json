 "longDesc": "This area was clearly once used for cultivating plants- exotic and magical ones, if you had to guess. The lack of active cultivation doesn't seem to have done them much real harm- the room has a thick coating og dark green moss over every surface, a few bright floral blooms peak out between the leaves, and the air is thick with petrichor.",
