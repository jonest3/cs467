You stand burried deeply in the forgotten jungle tucked away between mountains at the entrace to the lost ruins of \nCastle Charenji where you believe the Golden Scepter of Ma-go'Faan has been hidden for thousands of years.\nYou know that if you can find and retrieve the scepter, you would never have to work another day in your life.\n\nThe catch?\n\nThe castle is said to be cursed and that anyone who seeks the scepter will undoubtedly perish before they can retrieve it.\n\nBut, you don't really believe in curses...right?\n",
