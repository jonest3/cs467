Project: CMD1


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For our checkpoint, we wanted to demonstrate the components of the game that we have working.  
Currently, we are able to load data and use it to set up our game engine.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission Contents (54 items):
- README.md
- gameEngine.py
- testGame.py
- game_handler.py
- gameSetup.py
- game_struct.py
- InitGame Directory Including:
--- Items
------ Subsequent files
--- Rooms
------ Subsequent files
--- Shelves
--- Doors
--- Traps


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Compile & Run: "python3 gameSetup.py"


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Status:

Currently, we are able to load data, instantiate Room, Item, Player, ang Game classes.  We are storing 
the data that will be used in our text game as json files and loading them into the GameComponent class.  
The data helps us isntantiate the different classes for us to use in our game play.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Test the code:

We have created a test class that will allow you to test different functionality with our code.  
We have been using these tests to find and fix bugs.

Upon compiling and running the code, a test menu should be displayed and you should be able to choose 
between the different tests by entering the corresponding integer.  

You can continue to test functionality or you can exit the test by entering 0.  These tests should be a 
good representation of our functional code.

Some tests will ask you to enter additional information so that it can test actual functionality that 
will be implemented in the game itself.

We feel good about where we are at with the code and should be able to have a functional game by the end
of this week.
