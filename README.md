Group Name: Corvus
Project: CMD1

For our checkpoint, we wanted to demonstrate the components of the game that we have working.  
Currently, we are able to load data and use it to set up our game engine.



To Compile & Run: "python3 gameSetup.py"



To Test the code:

We have created a test class that will allow you to test different functionality with our code.  
We have been using these tests to find and fix bugs.

Upon compiling and running the code, a test menu should be displayed and you should be able to choose 
between the different tests by entering the corresponding integer.  

You can continue to test functionality or you can exit the test by entering 0.

Some tests will ask you to enter additional information so that it can test actual functionality that 
will be implemented in the game itself.
